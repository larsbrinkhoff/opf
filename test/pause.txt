Test out posix-pause.

Does so by just calling it after setting up a handler for SIGINT.
If you run this inside Shell Mode in GNU Emacs then an easy way to
send SIGINT is just to type C-c C-c.

Run it by doing :-

   $ ../opf -l../lib -l. pause.opf  

and if all is well you should see :-

   pausing ...

If you now send a SIGINT (C-c C-c from inside Emacs) then you should
see :-

   caught signal 2
   pausing over, bye
