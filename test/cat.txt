A simple version of cat(1).

This version only works on files, it does not accept standard input.
(The only reason for this is that opf doesn't have comparisons yet).

read ( fd[n] -- n )
   Reads <code>buffer#</code> bytes into <code>buffer</code> returning
   the number read.


write ( nbytes[n] -- n )
   Writes <code>nbytes</code> from <code>buffer</code> to the standard output
   returning the number of bytes written.


close ( fd[n] -- )
  Close the file descriptor and ignore the result.


cat-fd ( fd[n] -- )
   Reads from fd in <code>buffer#</code> chunks and writes the chunks to
   the standard output.


open ( file-name[c-addr] -- fd[n] )
   Opens the NUL terminated <code>file-name</code> and returns the
   file descriptor <code>fd</code>.  If <code>fd</code> is less than
   or equal to 0 then the file could not be opened.


error ( file-name[c-addr] -- )
   Output an error message containing the script and file-name.


cat-file ( file-name[c-addr] -- )
   Writes the contents of <code>file-name</code> to the standard output
   or reports an error if it cannot be opened.


do-all ( a-addr u -- )
   Applies <code>cat-file</code> to all the command line arguments.
