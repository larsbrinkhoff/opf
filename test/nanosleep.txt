Test out posix-nanosleep (with a little help from posix-sigaction)

The test involves setting up a signal handler for SIGINT and then
using posix-nanosleep to generate 5 second delay.  This gives you
5 seconds to interrupt the process otherwise it will exit normally.

Run it by doing :-

    $ ../opf -l../lib -l. nanosleep.opf
    you have 5 seconds to interrupt ...
    no interrupt, sleep period over

In this case, no interrupt was sent within 5 seconds.

    $ ../opf -l../lib -l. nanosleep.opf
    you have 5 seconds to interrupt ...
    interrupted sleep, with 4s 260000000us left
    $
